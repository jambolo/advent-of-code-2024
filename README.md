# Advent Of Code 2024
Advent of Code 2024 solutions in Haskell. The development environment is VSCode and stack in Windows.

### Day 1

In general terms, the solution for both parts of day 1 is trivial, but wow Haskell has a *steep* learning curve. Github Copilot is a savior.

### Day 2

Part 1 was trivial again and the biggest difficulty was dealing with Haskell. I tried to implement part 2 using recursion, but I couldn't get it to work. I gave up and implemented a more brute force O(n<sup>2</sup>) solution that I feel is not in the spirit of Haskell. I'm curious to see a real Haskell solution.

### Day 3

Trivial again. Luckily, Haskell has a regex library and the solution wasn't too hard to figure out once I figured out how to use the regex library.

### Day 4
Trivial. I added a little cleverness, but otherwise I just did it in a strightforward way. I'm glad Haskell has some comprehension and range support.

### Day 5
Seems simple enough.
